# Point the "S"ource directory at the working directory.  During the
# do_unpack stage -- which is inherited from base.bbclass -- all source
# code defined in SRC_URI is uncompressed to ${WORKDIR}.  Because the
# source code for this recipe has no directory structure, we'll just point
# it to the working directory.
# For projects that are pulled from git, this would usually be
# "${WORKDIR}/git".

# handful of other paths will automatically get packaged.  Files going to

# packaged.  To add files and directories to get packaged, add them to this
# variable and uncomment it.
